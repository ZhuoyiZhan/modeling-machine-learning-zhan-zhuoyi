 Question 4.4

 (a) On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?

 Becuase there is only 1 feature and it is uniformly distributed, so on average we will use 10% of the obervation


 (b)

 1%


 (c)

0.01^100 *100 = 10^-98 %


(d)

The fraction of training data near test test observation decrease exponentially.

(e)
 l = 0.1^(1/p)
the volumn of hypercubeâ€™ will be 10% of the total volume of space in the p-dimension cube.
